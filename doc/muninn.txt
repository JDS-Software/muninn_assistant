1. INTRODUCTION                                         *muninn-introduction*

Muninn provides AI-powered code editing via the Claude API. Place your cursor
on a function, run a command, and Claude rewrites it in-place. Animated visual
feedback is displayed during operations.

Features:

- Autocomplete the function at your cursor.
- Describe edits in a floating prompt; Claude rewrites the function.
- Ask a question about your code and see the answer in a floating window.
- The current function scope is highlighted as you navigate.

Security notice: Muninn invokes the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess. Your
buffer contents are sent to the Claude API over the network. Do not use
Muninn on files containing secrets, credentials, or sensitive data you would
not send to a third-party API.

==============================================================================
2. REQUIREMENTS                                         *muninn-requirements*

- Neovim 0.10+ with tree-sitter support
- Tree-sitter parsers installed for your languages
- Claude Code CLI installed and on your `$PATH`
  https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

3. SETUP                                                      *muninn-setup*
                                                           *muninn.setup()*

Muninn initializes automatically when loaded. No explicit setup call is
required. If you want to call setup manually (e.g., for lazy-loading): >lua

    require("muninn").setup()
<
No user configuration options are supported yet.

4. COMMANDS                                                *muninn-commands*

                                                      *:MuninnAutocomplete*
:MuninnAutocomplete     Auto-complete the function at the cursor. Claude
                        analyzes the function body and surrounding context,
                        then replaces the function with a completed version.

                                                           *:MuninnPrompt*
:MuninnPrompt           Open a floating prompt where you describe the edit
                        you want. Claude rewrites the function at the cursor
                        according to your instructions. See |muninn-prompt|.

                                                         *:MuninnQuestion*
:MuninnQuestion         Open a floating prompt to ask a question about your
                        code. The answer is displayed in a floating window.
                        The buffer is not modified.

                                                              *:MuninnLog*
:MuninnLog              Show the session log in a floating window.

==============================================================================
5. KEYMAPS                                                  *muninn-keymaps*

Default keymaps are registered under the `<leader>m` prefix:

    `<leader>ma`    |:MuninnAutocomplete|
    `<leader>mp`    |:MuninnPrompt|
    `<leader>mq`    |:MuninnQuestion|
    `<leader>ml`    |:MuninnLog|

==============================================================================
6. PROMPT WINDOW                                             *muninn-prompt*

The floating prompt used by |:MuninnPrompt| and |:MuninnQuestion| supports
multi-line input with the following keybindings:

    `<C-s>`         Submit the prompt (works in normal and insert mode).
    `<Esc>`         Dismiss the prompt without submitting.

The prompt opens in insert mode. Closing the window by any other means
(e.g., `:q`) is treated as a dismissal.
