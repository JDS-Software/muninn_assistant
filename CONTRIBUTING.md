# Contributing to Huginn

Huginn is developed by a non-tech company with limited engineering resources dedicated to this project. As such, we are not actively accepting code contributions at this time.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. Include:

- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your Neovim version (`nvim --version`)
- Your plugin manager (lazy.nvim, packer.nvim, vim-plug, etc.)
- Any other plugins that might interact with Huginn
- Relevant parts of your Neovim configuration

## Feature Requests

For feature ideas or suggestions, please use the Discussions section rather than opening an issue. We may consider requests that align with the project's goals, but cannot make commitments about implementation.

## Why No Pull Requests?

Reviewing and maintaining external contributions requires engineering time that we don't have available. This policy keeps the project sustainable for us while still sharing it with the community.

Thank you for understanding.
